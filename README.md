# Out-look-data-analytics-of-12-percent-subscription-
The data which is being shared is a part (12%) of the subscription base that we are having. This data has been restructured for the purpose of internship learnings. The findings from this data will not be tallying with the actual scenario. 


problem statement:

1. Convert the data set into a structured format.
2. For each tenure, find brandwise how many subscriptions were purchased.
3. In the period May 2024 to March 2025, find the expires in a brand wise and month wise manner.
4. For each brand find the top 40 cities. [If you are having cities named as ABC North, ABC South, ABC West, you need to group them together under a common city named as ABC]
5. Prepare gender ratio for each brand.
6. Analyze the designations of the subscribers in a brand wise manner.
7. What is the contribution of each city to the total number of subscribers for a brand.
8. Analyze the contribution of each state to the total number of subscribers for each brand.
